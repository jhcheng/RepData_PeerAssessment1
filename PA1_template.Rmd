## Loading and preprocessing the data
Load data from file `activity.csv`:
```{r loadData}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=T, stringsAsFactors=F)
```

Remove data with missing value:
```{r}
ok <- complete.cases(data)
data_ok <- data[ok,]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
First, calculate the total number of steps taken each day:
```{r}
sum_per_day <- tapply(data_ok$steps, as.factor(data_ok$date), sum)
sum_per_day
```

Then make a histogram of sum_per_day:
```{r figSumPerDay}
hist(sum_per_day, xlab="Total Number of Steps", main="")
```

Calculate and report the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day:
```{r}
mean(sum_per_day)
median(sum_per_day)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
First, calculate 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days:
```{r}
avg_per_interval <- tapply(data_ok$steps, as.factor(data_ok$interval), mean)
head(avg_per_interval,100)  # print first 100 resuts
```

Then make a time series plot:
```{r figAvgPerInterval}
plot(names(avg_per_interval), 
     avg_per_interval, 
     type="l", 
     xlab="Interval", 
     ylab="Average Number of Steps")
```

We can get the 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, which contains the maximum number of steps:
```{r}
avg_per_interval[which.max(avg_per_interval)]
```

## Imputing missing values
First, calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs):
```{r}
sum(!ok)
```

Second, devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. Here we use **the mean for that 5-minute interval** to fill the missing values:
```{r}
data_imputing <- data
data_imputing <- within(data_imputing, 
                        steps <- ifelse(is.na(steps), 
                                        round(avg_per_interval[as.character(interval)]) , 
                                        steps))
```

We have already created a new dataset `data_imputing` that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in. We can check it:
```{r}
# first 20 rows of original dataset
head(data, 20) 
```

```{r}
# first 20 rows of new dataset
head(data_imputing, 20) 
```

Finally, make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with **new** dataset:
```{r figSumPerDayImputing}
# calculate the total number of steps taken each day with new dataset
sum_per_day_imputing <- tapply(data_imputing$steps, 
                               as.factor(data_imputing$date), sum)
hist(sum_per_day_imputing, xlab="Total Number of Steps", main="")
```

And Calculate the **mean** and **median** total number of steps taken per day with **new** dataset:
```{r}
mean(sum_per_day_imputing)
median(sum_per_day_imputing)
```
We can see the mean and median(10766, 10762) is very close to values before imputing missing values(10766, 10765). This is because we `round` the mean of 5-minute interval to fill in missing values. If we use different strategy such as `ceiling` or `floor`, the new mean and median will be more away from values before imputing. Let's try it:
```{r}
# ceiling the mean
data_imputing_ceil <- data
data_imputing_ceil <- within(data_imputing_ceil, 
                        steps <- ifelse(is.na(steps), 
                                        ceiling(avg_per_interval[as.character(interval)]) , 
                                        steps))
sum_per_day_imputing_ceil <- tapply(data_imputing_ceil$steps, 
                                    as.factor(data_imputing_ceil$date), sum)
mean(sum_per_day_imputing_ceil)
median(sum_per_day_imputing_ceil)
```

```{r}
# floor the mean
data_imputing_floor <- data
data_imputing_floor <- within(data_imputing_floor, 
                        steps <- ifelse(is.na(steps), 
                                        floor(avg_per_interval[as.character(interval)]) , 
                                        steps))
sum_per_day_imputing_floor <- tapply(data_imputing_floor$steps, 
                                     as.factor(data_imputing_floor$date), sum)
mean(sum_per_day_imputing_floor)
median(sum_per_day_imputing_floor)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
First, we need to create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# cast date from character to Date class
data_imputing$date <- as.Date(data_imputing$date)
data_imputing$wd <- sapply(data_imputing$date, function(x) {
  day <- weekdays(x)
  ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")
})
# check it
head(data_imputing)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

To do it, we need to calculate the average by weekday days and weekend days:
```{r}
averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + wd, data=data_imputing, mean)
```

Finally, we can plot the dataset using package `gglot2`:
```{r fig.show='hide'}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(averages, aes(interval, steps, group=wd))
p <- g + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~ wd, nrow=2) +
  xlab("Interval") +
  ylab("Average Number of Steps")
print(p)
```

<!-- Because of some technical issue, knit cannot show plot correctly. 
     So we create the picture file first.
